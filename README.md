# Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This project provides a simple Java class for generating Fibonacci sequences and includes JUnit tests to verify the correctness of the generation.

## Usage

The `Fib` class contains a `generate(int n)` method that generates the first `n` numbers of the Fibonacci sequence. The provided JUnit test ensures that the generated sequence has the correct size and contains the expected Fibonacci numbers.

## Prerequisites

To use or contribute to this project, you will need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse (optional)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can clone the repository and open it in your favorite Java development environment. Make sure you have the necessary prerequisites installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/worthychukwuemeka/fibonnaci-sequence.git
cd fibonacci-sequence
```

## Running the Tests
This project includes JUnit tests to verify the functionality of the generate method. To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in your Java IDE.
2. Locate the FibTest class (in the test.java package).
3. Right-click on the testGenerateFibonacciSequence method and select "Run" or "Debug."
T4. he test will execute, and you will see the results in your IDE's test runner.
